### __About me:__
I am 19 years old, I was born in Ukraine and moved to Poland, where I have been living for four years and studying to be a programmer. Staying ahead of the syllabus, I learn FrontEnd and BackEnd while working as a freelancer. I learned new technologies and used them empirically, which for me is the most effective way of learning.

I want to establish a contact with the company and prove myself before starting work. Until the start, I definitely want to get acquainted with the new essential technologies.
